  abstract = {The recognition of several new types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in recent years has led to proposals for changing lymphoma classifications, including a new proposal put forth by the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG). However, the clinical significance of the new entities and the practical utility of this new proposal have not been studied. Therefore, we performed a clinical evaluation of the ILSG classification. A cohort of 1,403 cases of NHL was organized at nine study sites around the world and consisted of consecutive patients seen between 1988 and 1990 who were previously untreated. A detailed protocol for histologic and clinical analysis was followed at each site, and immunologic characterization as to T- or B-cell phenotype was required. Five expert hematopathologists visited the sites and each classified each case using the ILSG classification. A consensus diagnosis was also reached in each case, and each expert rereviewed a 20\% random sample of the cases. Clinical correlations and survival analyses were then performed. A diagnosis of NHL was confirmed in 1,378 (98.2\%) of the cases. The most common lymphoma types were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31\%) and follicular lymphoma (22\%), whereas the new entities comprised 21\% of the cases. Diagnostic accuracy was at least 85\% for most of the major lymphoma types, and reproducibility of the diagnosis was 85\%. Immunophenotyping improved the diagnostic accuracy by 10\% to 45\% for a number of the major types. The clinical features of the new entities were distinctive. Both the histologic types and the patient characteristics as defined by the International Prognostic Index predicted for patient survival. In conclusion we found that the ILSG classification can be readily applied and identifies clinically distinctive types of NHL. However, for clinical application, prognostic factors as defined by the International Prognostic Index must be combined with the histologic diagnosis for appropriate clinical decisions.},

  abstract = {As the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) incidence patterns generally parallel that for NHL overall. Globally, DLBCL accounts for a third of all NHLs, ranging between 20% and 50% by country. Based on United States (U.S.) cancer registry data, age-standardized incidence rate for DLBCL was 7.2 per 100,000. DLBCL incidence rises with age and is generally higher in males than females; in the U.S., incidence is highest among non-Hispanic whites (9.2/100,000). Like NHL incidence, DLBCL incidence rose in the first half of the 20th century but has largely plateaued. However, there is some evidence that incidence rates are rising in areas of historically low rates, such as Asia; there are also estimates for rising DLBCL incidence in the near future due to the changing demographics in developed countries whose aging population is growing. Established risk factors for DLBCL include those that result in severe immune deficiency such as HIV/AIDS, inherited immunodeficiency syndromes, and organ transplant recipients. Factors that lead to chronic immune dysregulations are also established risk factors, and include a number of autoimmune conditions (eg, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), viral infections (eg, HIV, KSHV/HHV8, HCV, EBV), and obesity. Family history of NHL/DLBCL, personal history of cancer, and multiple genetic susceptibility loci are also well-established risk factors for DLBCL. There is strong evidence for multiple environmental exposures in DLBCL etiology, including exposure to trichloroethylene, benzene, and pesticides and herbicides, with recent associations noted with glyphosate. There is also strong evidence for associations with other viruses, such as HBV. Recent estimates suggest that obesity accounts for nearly a quarter of DLBCLs that develop, but despite recent gains in the understanding of DLBCL etiology, the majority of disease remain unexplained. An understanding of the host and environmental contributions to disease etiology, and concerted efforts to expand our understanding to multiple race/ethnic groups, will be essential for constructing clinically relevant risk prediction models and develop effective strategies for disease prevention.}

Purpose
Approximately 5\% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are double-hit lymphomas (DHLs) with translocations of both MYC and BCL2. DHLs are characterized by poor outcome. We tested whether DLBCLs with high expression of MYC protein and BCL2 protein share the clinical features and poor prognosis of DHLs.

Patients and Methods
Paraffin-embedded lymphoma samples from 193 patients with de novo DLBCL who were uniformly treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) were studied using immunohistochemistry for MYC, BCL2, CD10, BCL6, and MUM1/interferon regulatory factor 4, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for MYC and BCL2.

Results
FISH analysis identified DHL in 6\% of patients, who showed the expected poor overall survival (OS; P = .002). On the basis of immunohistochemical MYC and BCL2 expression, a double-hit score (DHS) was assigned to all patients with DLBCL. The DHS-2 group, defined by high expression of both MYC and BCL2 protein, comprised 29\% of the patients. DHS 2 was significantly associated with lower complete response rate (P = .004), shorter OS (P \&lt; .001), and shorter progression-free survival (PFS; P \&lt; .001). The highly significant correlation with OS and PFS was maintained in multivariate models that controlled for the International Prognostic Index and the cell-of-origin subtype (OS, P \&lt; .001; PFS, P \&lt; .001). DHS was validated in an independent cohort of 116 patients who were treated with R-CHOP.

Conclusion
The immunohistochemical DHS defined a large subset of DLBCLs with double-hit biology and was strongly associated with poor outcome in patients treated with R-CHOP.

Purpose
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is curable in 60\% of patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). MYC translocations, with or without BCL2 translocations, have been associated with inferior survival in DLBCL. We investigated whether expression of MYC protein, with or without BCL2 protein expression, could risk-stratify patients at diagnosis.
Patients and Methods
We determined the correlation between presence of MYC and BCL2 proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with survival in two independent cohorts of patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. We further determined if MYC protein expression correlated with high MYC mRNA and/or presence of MYC translocation.
Results
In the training cohort (n = 167), MYC and BCL2 proteins were detected in 29\% and 44\% of patients, respectively. Concurrent expression (MYC positive/BCL2 positive) was present in 21\% of patients. MYC protein correlated with presence of high MYC mRNA and MYC translocation (both P \&lt; .001), but the latter was less frequent (both 11\%). MYC protein expression was only associated with inferior overall and progression-free survival when BCL2 protein was coexpressed (P \&lt; .001). Importantly, the poor prognostic effect of MYC positive/BCL2 positive was validated in an independent cohort of 140 patients with DLBCL and remained significant (P \&lt; .05) after adjusting for presence of high-risk features in a multivariable model that included elevated international prognostic index score, activated B-cell molecular subtype, and presence of concurrent MYC and BCL2 translocations.
Conclusion
Assessment of MYC and BCL2 expression by IHC represents a robust, rapid, and inexpensive approach to risk-stratify patients with DLBCL at diagnosis. }

  abstract = {Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) has been defined by others as a B-cell lymphoma with MYC/8q24 rearrangement in combination with a translocation involving another gene, such as BCL2, BCL3, or BCL6. The most common form of DHL has translocations involving MYC and BCL2, also known as MYC/BCL2 DHL. In recent years, a number of case series of MYC/BCL2 DHL have been published. Most cases of MYC/BCL2 DHL morphologically resemble diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma. These tumors are of B-cell lineage, have a germinal center B-cell immunophenotype with a high proliferation rate, and a complex karyotype. Patients with these tumors have an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis despite high-intensity chemotherapy. More recently, studies have suggested expanding the spectrum of MYC/BCL2 DHL to include cases that have concurrent MYC and BCL2 cytogenetic abnormalities, but not necessarily translocations. In addition, overexpression of MYC and BCL2 has been shown in an appreciable subset of DLBCL tumors. These tumors show overlap with MYC/BCL2 DHL, but are not equivalent. In this review, we discuss the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and prognostic features of MYC/BCL2 DHL.},

  abstract = {Abstract
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL) is characterized by a marked degree of morphologic and clinical heterogeneity. We studied 156 patients with de novo DLCL for rearrangements of the BCL2, BCL6, and MYC oncogenes by Southern blot analysis and BCL2 protein expression. We related these data to the primary site of presentation, disease stage, and other clinical risk factors. Structural alterations of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were detected in 25 of 156, 36 of 116, and 10 of 151 patients, respectively. Three cases showed a combination of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, and two cases had a combination of BCL6 and MYC rearrangements. BCL2 rearrangement was found more often in extensive (39%) and primary nodal (17%) lymphomas than in extranodal cases (4%) (P = .003). BCL2 rearrangement was present in none of 40 patients with stage I disease, but in 22% of patients with stage II to IV (P = .006). The presence of BCL2 rearrangements did not significantly affect overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS). In contrast, high BCL2 protein expression adversely affected both OS (P = .008) and DFS (P = .01). BCL2 protein expression was poorly correlated with BCL2 rearrangement: only 52% of BCL2-rearranged lymphomas and 37% of BCL2-unrearranged cases had high BCL2 protein expression. Rearrangement of BCL6 was found more often in patients with extranodal (36%) and extensive (39%) presentation versus primary nodal disease (28%). No significant correlation was found with disease stage, lymphadenopathy, or bone marrow involvement. DFS and OS were not influenced by BCL6 rearrangements. MYC rearrangements were found in 16% of primary extranodal lymphomas, versus 2% of primary nodal cases (P = .02). In particular, gastrointestinal (GI) lymphomas (5 of 18 cases, 28%) were affected by MYC rearrangements. The distinct biologic behavior of these extranodal lymphomas was reflected by a high complete remission (CR) rate: 7 of 10 patients with MYC rearrangement attained complete remission and 6 responders remained alive for more than 4 years, resulting in a trend for better DFS (P = .07). These data show the complex nature of molecular events in DLCL, which is a reflection of the morphologic and clinical heterogeneity of these lymphomas. However, thus far, these genetic rearrangements fail as prognostic markers. © 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.}

  abstract = {Male gender was recently reported as an adverse prognostic factor in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone). We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients with DLBCL initially treated with rituximab containing regimens between 2001 and 2007. Patients were identified from the clinical archives of 43 Italian and Brazilian institutions. The principal endpoint was overall survival (OS). One thousand seven hundred and ninety-three patients were fully eligible for the study. Thirty-eight percent, 27\%, 22\% and 12\% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 0–1, 2, 3 and 4–5, respectively; 53\% were males. After a median follow-up of 36 months (1–106), the 5-year OS was 76\% (95\% confidence interval 74–78\%). In univariate analysis, male gender was an adverse prognostic factor with a hazard ratio of 1.52. In multivariate analysis, when adjusted by IPI, again gender maintained its prognostic relevance, showing an independent additive effect. In conclusion, in patients with DLBCL treated with rituximab containing regimens, gender may increase the predictive power of the IPI. Based on these results, given possible differences in blood clearance of rituximab between males and females, the benefit of higher doses of rituximab in males should be explored.}

An international trial was also undertaken in younger patients, the MabThera International Trial (MInT).5 The initial rituximab-CHOP (R-CHOP) regimens were empirically designed. These trials were designed without a pharmacologic understanding of rituximab or the half-life of the drug. The outcomes of these trials reported an improved overall survival (OS) when compared with CHOP or CHOP-like regimens and led to the approval of rituximab in combination with CHOP in the United States in February 2006 and in countries worldwide. This was the first monoclonal antibody approved in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.The publication by the Groupe d’ Etude des Lymphomes de L’Adulte was a landmark observation.3 Clinical trials incorporating rituximab into other investigations including the rituximab with CHOP over the age of 60 (RICOVER-60) and the Mega–CHOP plus etoposide (CHOEP) trials were performed.6},

The International Prognostic Index (IPI) strongly predicted overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival, but high age (\&gt;68 vs ≤68 years) had no significant influence on response rate (p = 0.86) or PFS (p = 0.14).

  abstract = {Our aim was to describe a large population-based cohort of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) during the last decade, evaluating possible improvement in survival and to identify subgroups in need of novel treatment strategies. The study population encompassed all patients diagnosed with DLBCL in Sweden from 2000 through 2010. Altogether 5349 patients were identified. There was no increase in incidence for females, but for males there was an estimated yearly increase in incidence by 0.019 per 10 000. When adjusted for age and gender, the improvement in overall survival for the whole group was estimated at 4.5\% per year, most prominent in the age group 60–78 years, and in patients with good performance status. In this large dataset, we were able to detect a clear improvement in overall survival in DLBCL, although restricted to specific prognostic subgroups, and to identify specific disease presentations that significantly affect overall survival.}

  abstract = {Abstract Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite a high cure rate, too many patients show refractory (ref) or relapsed (rel) disease. This study examines the frequency of recurring gene mutations and their interplay with well-known biomarkers in female and male patients between 18 and 80 years with ref/rel DLBCL compared to patients with complete remission (CR) to identify biological risk factors associated with treatment response, using cohorts of R-CHOP-like treated DLBCL enrolled in clinical trials of the DSHNHL. The biomarker profile of patients differed between younger and elderly patients with ref/rel DLBCL, with a higher frequency of BCL2 translocations in younger patients, and higher numbers of ABC subtypes and MYC protein expression in the elderly. Amplicon sequencing revealed generally higher mutation frequencies in the younger cohort. Mutations in CREBBP and TNFRSF14 were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) only in younger patients. A higher proportion of GNA13 mutations was detected in female patients of the elderly DLBCL patient cohort, clearly emphasizing the striking differences in biomarker distribution between younger and elderly as well as female and male patients.}

We examined global transcriptome DLBCL data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via a systems biology approach to determine the molecular differences associated with age and sex. Collectively, sex and age revealed striking transcriptional differences with older age associated with decreased metabolism and telomere functions and female sex was associated with decreased interferon signaling, transcription, cell cycle, and PD-1 signaling. We discovered that the key genes for most groups strongly regulated immune function activity. Furthermore, older females were predicted to have less DLBCL progression versus older males and young females. Finally, analyses in systems biology revealed that JUN and CYCS signaling were the most critical factors associated with tumor progression in older and male patients. We identified important molecular perturbations in DLBCL that were strongly associated with age and sex and were predicted to strongly influence tumor progression.}

We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.}

To investigate the frequency and clinicopathologic significance of the MYD88 L265P mutation in DLBCLs, we conducted a meta-analysis of 40 published studies on 2736 DLBCL patients. We collected relevant published research findings identified using the PubMed and Embase databases. The effect sizes of outcome parameters were calculated using a random-effects model. In this meta-analysis, the MYD88 L265P mutation in DLBCL showed a significant difference according to tumor sites. The overall incidence of the MYD88 L265P mutation in DLBCLs, excluding the central nervous system and testicular DLBCLs, was 16.5%. Notably, the MYD88 L265P mutation rates of CNS and testicular DLBCL patients were 60% and 77%, respectively. Interestingly, the MYD88 L265P mutation was more frequently detected in activated B-cell-like (ABC) or non-germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) than GCB subtype (OR = 3.414, p < 0.001). The MYD88 L265P mutation was significantly associated with old age and poor overall survival, but not with sex and clinical stage. This pooled analysis demonstrates that the MYD88 L265P mutation is significantly associated with the tumor sites and molecular subtypes in DLBCL patients.}

Chromosomal MYC rearrangements and consequent MYC overexpression is the defining lesion in Burkitt lymphoma (BL), conferring a highly proliferative state. However, abnormalities of MYC are increasingly appreciated in non-BL histologies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and B-cell lymphomas intermediate between BL and DLBCL, with a particularly aggressive clinical phenotype. Although there are conflicting data regarding prognostic implications of isolated MYC aberrancy in these non-BLs, the co-occurrence of MYC rearrangements and either the antiapoptotic gene B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) or the transcriptional repressor BCL6 leads to an entity termed double-hit B-cell lymphoma (DHL) (or triple-hit if all 3 abnormalities are observed) with a particularly poor prognosis and no established treatment paradigms. Notably, a distinct pattern of gene expression profiling has been noted when MYC is overexpressed in BL compared with other lymphomas, supporting the notion that, although MYC promotes target gene transcription, the target genes vary by disease subtype. The frequency of MYC activity depends on the method of detection and ranges from 5\% to 10\% using fluorescence in situ hybridization but up to 30\% of DLBCL using immunohistochemistry. Standard therapies developed for DLBCL are less effective when the disease is driven by MYC, leading to lower response rates and response durations. An important clinical challenge is to pre-emptively identify MYC-associated lymphomas and to subsequently develop trials specifically for this group of patients. However, the design of such studies is complicated by variable definitions of MYC-associated lymphoid malignancies and the lack of effective therapies to date. The objective if the current review was to evaluate the implications of MYC aberrancy with respect to the B-cell lymphoma double-hit and triple-hit phenotypes and to consider the available data for clinical and practical management.

  abstract = {Abstract
  The prognostic significance of Bcl-2 protein expression and bcl-2 gene rearrangement in diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL) is controversial. Bcl-2 protein expression prevents apoptosis and may have an important role in clinical drug resistance. The presence of a bcl-2 gene rearrangement in de novo DLCL suggests a possible follicle center cell origin and perhaps a distinct clinical behavior more akin to low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of Bcl-2 protein expression and bcl-2 gene rearrangement (mbr and mcr) on survival of a cohort of patients with DLCL who were uniformly evaluated and treated with effective chemotherapy. Patients included the original MACOP-B cohort (n = 121) and the initial 18 patients treated with the VACOP-B regimen (total = 139). All patients had advanced-stage disease, were 16 to 70 years old, and corresponded to Working Formulation categories F, G, or H. No patients had prior treatment, discordant lymphoma, or human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity. Paraffin sections from diagnostic biopsies were analyzed for bcl-2 gene rearrangement including mbr and mcr breakpoints by polymerase chain reaction and Bcl-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. With a median follow-up of 81 months, overall (OS), disease-free (DFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were measured to determine the prognostic significance of these parameters. Analyzable DNA was present in 118 of 139 (85%) cases, with 14 demonstrating a bcl-2 rearrangement (11 mbr, 3 mcr). All 14 of these bcl-2 gene rearrangement-positive cases were found in the 102 patients with a B-cell immunophenotype, but the presence of this rearrangement had no significant influence on survival. Bcl-2 protein expression was interpretable in 116 of 139 (83%) cases, with immunopositivity detected in 54 of 116 (47%). Using a cut-off of greater than 10% Bcl-2 immunopositive tumor cells for analysis, positive Bcl-2 protein expression was seen in 28 of 116 (24%) patients and the presence of this expression correlated with decreased 8-year OS (34% v 60%, P < .01), DFS (32% v 66%, P < .001), and RFS (25% v 59%, P < .001). Bcl-2 protein expression remained significant in multivariate analysis that included the clinical international prognostic index factors and immunophenotype (P < .02). In conclusion, although bcl-2 gene rearrangement status could not be shown to have an impact on outcome, Bcl-2 protein expression is a strong significant predictor of OS, DFS, and RFS in DLCLs.}

We have investigated the incidence and disease-specificity of BCL6 rearrangements in a large panel of lymphoid tumors, including acute and chronic lymphoid leukemias (96 cases), various NHL types (125 cases), and multiple myelomas (23 cases). BCL6 re-arrangements were found in 16/45 (35.5%) DLLC, more fre-quently in DLCL (15/33, 45%) than in MX-D (1/10, 10%), in 2/31 (6.4%) follicular NHL, and in no other tumor types. BCL6 rearrangements represent the first genetic lesion specifically and recurrently associated with DLLC and should prove useful for understanding the pathogenesis as well as for the clinical monitoring of these tumors.}

We have examined the structure of the c-myc locus in primary tumor tissue of 10 cases of diffuse large-cell lymphoma. In one patient, Southern blot analysis revealed additional c-myc fragments in the tumor DMA but not in the germ-line DNA. Southern blot analysis using probes from both the heavy-and light-chain immunoglobin loci showed that the myc rearrangement was unlikely to involve the immunoglobulin loci in this patient.},

Clinical features from 1650 adults with de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) diagnosed from 2000-2010 at 7 NCCN cancer centers were assessed for their prognostic significance, with statistical efforts to further refine the categorization of age and normalized LDH. Five predictors (age, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sites of involvement, Ann Arbor stage, ECOG performance status) were identified and a maximum of 8 points assigned. Four risk groups were formed: low (0-1), low-intermediate (2-3), high-intermediate (4-5), and high (6-8). Compared with the IPI, the NCCN-IPI better discriminated low- and high-risk subgroups (5-year overall survival [OS]: 96\% vs 33\%) than the IPI (5 year OS: 90\% vs 54\%), respectively. When validated using an independent cohort from the British Columbia Cancer Agency (n = 1138), it also demonstrated enhanced discrimination for both low- and high-risk patients.

  abstract = "▪ Abstract  It is widely but incorrectly believed that the t-test and linear regression are valid only for Normally distributed outcomes. The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.",

Many methods have been developed and used for gene selection including signal-to-noise ratio, t-statistic, and partial least squares. However, the theoretical relationship among these methods is unclear. In this paper, we analyze the theoretical relationship among these methods and show that they are equivalent under certain conditions. We also propose a new method based on the Wilcoxon rank sum statistic for gene selection. Our simulation and real data analysis show that all these methods have similar performance in terms of classification accuracy.}

  abstract = {To classify cancer specimens by their gene expression profiles, we created a statistical method based on Bayes' rule that estimates the probability of membership in one of two cancer subgroups. We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68–74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P ≤ 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.}

  abstract = {Summary
Large B-cell lymphoma (LBL) with interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) rearrangement (LBL-IRF4), a provisional entity in the 2017 WHO classification, primarily arises in children and young adults and has a favorable prognosis. However, few studies have addressed the clinicopathologic and cytogenetic features of older adults with IRF4-rearranged B-cell lymphomas. From a database of all internal and external cases (08/01/2015 to 12/01/2020) on which interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed at the Mayo Clinic, we identified 43 patients with B-cell lymphoma and IRF4 rearrangements. Consistent features included large cell morphology, expression of CD20, BCL6, and MUM1, and absence of MYC-R. All pediatric cases (n = 12) arose in Waldeyer's ring (WR), cervical lymph node (CLN), or bowel, and lacked BCL6-R and BCL2-R, and all but one showed classic morphology. Adults with WR, CLN, or bowel involvement (n = 22) were younger (median 32 years). Their lymphomas resembled pediatric cases morphologically and lacked BCL2-R, although 30% harbored BCL6-R (P = 0.043). Lymphomas that involved other anatomic sites (n = 9) arose in older adults (median 68 years; P = 0.002) and often showed atypical morphology (P < 0.001). All lacked BCL6-R and 2 of 4 harbored BCL2-R (P < 0.001). LBL-IRF4 - arising in WR, CLN, or bowel may represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterized by pediatric/younger adult age, classic morphology, and lack of BCL2-R. In contrast, B-cell lymphomas with IRF4-R that arise in other sites usually involve older adults, are often morphologically atypical and/or harbor BCL2-R, and may be more akin to diffuse LBL, not otherwise specified.}

  abstract = {Motivation: DNA microarrays have recently been used for the purpose of monitoring expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously and identifying those genes that are differentially expressed. The probability that a false identification (type I error) is committed can increase sharplywhen the number of tested genes gets large. Correlation between the test statistics attributed to gene co-regulation and dependency in the measurement errors of the gene expression levels further complicates the problem. In this paper we address this very large multiplicity problem by adopting the false discovery rate (FDR) controlling approach. In order to address the dependency problem, we present three resampling-based FDR controlling procedures, that account for the test statistics distribution, and compare their performance to that of the naïve application of the linear step-up procedure in Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The proceduresare studied using simulated microarray data, and their performance is examined relative to their ease of implementation.Results: Comparative simulation analysis shows that all four FDR controlling procedures control the FDR at the desired level, and retain substantially more power then the family-wise error rate controlling procedures. In terms of power, using resampling of the marginal distribution of each test statistics substantially improves the performance over the naïve one. The highest power is achieved, at the expense of a more sophisticated algorithm, by the resampling-based procedures that resample the joint distribution of the test statistics and estimate the level of FDR control.Availability: An R program that adjusts p-values using FDR controlling procedures is freely available over the Internet at www.math.tau.ac.il/~ybenjaContact: anatr@post.tau.ac.il*To whom correspondence

  abstract = {Abstract
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most frequent type of B-cell lymphoma in adult patients but also occurs in children. Patients are currently assigned to therapy regimens based on arbitrarily chosen age limits only (eg, 18 or 60 years) and not biologically justified limits. A total of 364 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and related mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas other than Burkitt lymphoma from all age groups were analyzed by comprehensive molecular profiling. The probability of several biologic features previously reported to be associated with poor prognosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, such as ABC subtype, BCL2 expression, or cytogenetic complexity, increases with age at diagnosis. Similarly, various genetic features, such as IRF4 translocations, gains in 1q21, 18q21, 7p22, and 7q21, as well as changes in 3q27, including gains and translocations affecting the BCL6 locus, are significantly associated with patient age, but no cut-offs between age groups could be defined. If age was incorporated in multivariate analyses, genetic complexity lost its prognostic significance, whereas the prognostic impact of ABC subtype and age were additive. Our data indicate that aging is a major determinant of lymphoma biology. They challenge current concepts regarding both prognostic biomarkers and treatment stratification based on strict age cut-offs.}
