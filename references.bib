    abstract = {The recognition of several new types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in recent years has led to proposals for changing lymphoma classifications, including a new proposal put forth by the International Lymphoma Study Group (ILSG). However, the clinical significance of the new entities and the practical utility of this new proposal have not been studied. Therefore, we performed a clinical evaluation of the ILSG classification. A cohort of 1,403 cases of NHL was organized at nine study sites around the world and consisted of consecutive patients seen between 1988 and 1990 who were previously untreated. A detailed protocol for histologic and clinical analysis was followed at each site, and immunologic characterization as to T- or B-cell phenotype was required. Five expert hematopathologists visited the sites and each classified each case using the ILSG classification. A consensus diagnosis was also reached in each case, and each expert rereviewed a 20\% random sample of the cases. Clinical correlations and survival analyses were then performed. A diagnosis of NHL was confirmed in 1,378 (98.2\%) of the cases. The most common lymphoma types were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31\%) and follicular lymphoma (22\%), whereas the new entities comprised 21\% of the cases. Diagnostic accuracy was at least 85\% for most of the major lymphoma types, and reproducibility of the diagnosis was 85\%. Immunophenotyping improved the diagnostic accuracy by 10\% to 45\% for a number of the major types. The clinical features of the new entities were distinctive. Both the histologic types and the patient characteristics as defined by the International Prognostic Index predicted for patient survival. In conclusion we found that the ILSG classification can be readily applied and identifies clinically distinctive types of NHL. However, for clinical application, prognostic factors as defined by the International Prognostic Index must be combined with the histologic diagnosis for appropriate clinical decisions.},

abstract = {As the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) incidence patterns generally parallel that for NHL overall. Globally, DLBCL accounts for a third of all NHLs, ranging between 20% and 50% by country. Based on United States (U.S.) cancer registry data, age-standardized incidence rate for DLBCL was 7.2 per 100,000. DLBCL incidence rises with age and is generally higher in males than females; in the U.S., incidence is highest among non-Hispanic whites (9.2/100,000). Like NHL incidence, DLBCL incidence rose in the first half of the 20th century but has largely plateaued. However, there is some evidence that incidence rates are rising in areas of historically low rates, such as Asia; there are also estimates for rising DLBCL incidence in the near future due to the changing demographics in developed countries whose aging population is growing. Established risk factors for DLBCL include those that result in severe immune deficiency such as HIV/AIDS, inherited immunodeficiency syndromes, and organ transplant recipients. Factors that lead to chronic immune dysregulations are also established risk factors, and include a number of autoimmune conditions (eg, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), viral infections (eg, HIV, KSHV/HHV8, HCV, EBV), and obesity. Family history of NHL/DLBCL, personal history of cancer, and multiple genetic susceptibility loci are also well-established risk factors for DLBCL. There is strong evidence for multiple environmental exposures in DLBCL etiology, including exposure to trichloroethylene, benzene, and pesticides and herbicides, with recent associations noted with glyphosate. There is also strong evidence for associations with other viruses, such as HBV. Recent estimates suggest that obesity accounts for nearly a quarter of DLBCLs that develop, but despite recent gains in the understanding of DLBCL etiology, the majority of disease remain unexplained. An understanding of the host and environmental contributions to disease etiology, and concerted efforts to expand our understanding to multiple race/ethnic groups, will be essential for constructing clinically relevant risk prediction models and develop effective strategies for disease prevention.}

Purpose
Approximately 5\% of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are double-hit lymphomas (DHLs) with translocations of both MYC and BCL2. DHLs are characterized by poor outcome. We tested whether DLBCLs with high expression of MYC protein and BCL2 protein share the clinical features and poor prognosis of DHLs.

Patients and Methods
Paraffin-embedded lymphoma samples from 193 patients with de novo DLBCL who were uniformly treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) were studied using immunohistochemistry for MYC, BCL2, CD10, BCL6, and MUM1/interferon regulatory factor 4, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for MYC and BCL2.

Results
FISH analysis identified DHL in 6\% of patients, who showed the expected poor overall survival (OS; P = .002). On the basis of immunohistochemical MYC and BCL2 expression, a double-hit score (DHS) was assigned to all patients with DLBCL. The DHS-2 group, defined by high expression of both MYC and BCL2 protein, comprised 29\% of the patients. DHS 2 was significantly associated with lower complete response rate (P = .004), shorter OS (P \&lt; .001), and shorter progression-free survival (PFS; P \&lt; .001). The highly significant correlation with OS and PFS was maintained in multivariate models that controlled for the International Prognostic Index and the cell-of-origin subtype (OS, P \&lt; .001; PFS, P \&lt; .001). DHS was validated in an independent cohort of 116 patients who were treated with R-CHOP.

Conclusion
The immunohistochemical DHS defined a large subset of DLBCLs with double-hit biology and was strongly associated with poor outcome in patients treated with R-CHOP.

Purpose
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is curable in 60\% of patients treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). MYC translocations, with or without BCL2 translocations, have been associated with inferior survival in DLBCL. We investigated whether expression of MYC protein, with or without BCL2 protein expression, could risk-stratify patients at diagnosis.
Patients and Methods
We determined the correlation between presence of MYC and BCL2 proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with survival in two independent cohorts of patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP. We further determined if MYC protein expression correlated with high MYC mRNA and/or presence of MYC translocation.
Results
In the training cohort (n = 167), MYC and BCL2 proteins were detected in 29\% and 44\% of patients, respectively. Concurrent expression (MYC positive/BCL2 positive) was present in 21\% of patients. MYC protein correlated with presence of high MYC mRNA and MYC translocation (both P \&lt; .001), but the latter was less frequent (both 11\%). MYC protein expression was only associated with inferior overall and progression-free survival when BCL2 protein was coexpressed (P \&lt; .001). Importantly, the poor prognostic effect of MYC positive/BCL2 positive was validated in an independent cohort of 140 patients with DLBCL and remained significant (P \&lt; .05) after adjusting for presence of high-risk features in a multivariable model that included elevated international prognostic index score, activated B-cell molecular subtype, and presence of concurrent MYC and BCL2 translocations.
Conclusion
Assessment of MYC and BCL2 expression by IHC represents a robust, rapid, and inexpensive approach to risk-stratify patients with DLBCL at diagnosis. }

  abstract = {Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) has been defined by others as a B-cell lymphoma with MYC/8q24 rearrangement in combination with a translocation involving another gene, such as BCL2, BCL3, or BCL6. The most common form of DHL has translocations involving MYC and BCL2, also known as MYC/BCL2 DHL. In recent years, a number of case series of MYC/BCL2 DHL have been published. Most cases of MYC/BCL2 DHL morphologically resemble diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma. These tumors are of B-cell lineage, have a germinal center B-cell immunophenotype with a high proliferation rate, and a complex karyotype. Patients with these tumors have an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis despite high-intensity chemotherapy. More recently, studies have suggested expanding the spectrum of MYC/BCL2 DHL to include cases that have concurrent MYC and BCL2 cytogenetic abnormalities, but not necessarily translocations. In addition, overexpression of MYC and BCL2 has been shown in an appreciable subset of DLBCL tumors. These tumors show overlap with MYC/BCL2 DHL, but are not equivalent. In this review, we discuss the clinicopathologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and prognostic features of MYC/BCL2 DHL.},

abstract = {Abstract
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL) is characterized by a marked degree of morphologic and clinical heterogeneity. We studied 156 patients with de novo DLCL for rearrangements of the BCL2, BCL6, and MYC oncogenes by Southern blot analysis and BCL2 protein expression. We related these data to the primary site of presentation, disease stage, and other clinical risk factors. Structural alterations of BCL2, BCL6, and MYC were detected in 25 of 156, 36 of 116, and 10 of 151 patients, respectively. Three cases showed a combination of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangements, and two cases had a combination of BCL6 and MYC rearrangements. BCL2 rearrangement was found more often in extensive (39%) and primary nodal (17%) lymphomas than in extranodal cases (4%) (P = .003). BCL2 rearrangement was present in none of 40 patients with stage I disease, but in 22% of patients with stage II to IV (P = .006). The presence of BCL2 rearrangements did not significantly affect overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS). In contrast, high BCL2 protein expression adversely affected both OS (P = .008) and DFS (P = .01). BCL2 protein expression was poorly correlated with BCL2 rearrangement: only 52% of BCL2-rearranged lymphomas and 37% of BCL2-unrearranged cases had high BCL2 protein expression. Rearrangement of BCL6 was found more often in patients with extranodal (36%) and extensive (39%) presentation versus primary nodal disease (28%). No significant correlation was found with disease stage, lymphadenopathy, or bone marrow involvement. DFS and OS were not influenced by BCL6 rearrangements. MYC rearrangements were found in 16% of primary extranodal lymphomas, versus 2% of primary nodal cases (P = .02). In particular, gastrointestinal (GI) lymphomas (5 of 18 cases, 28%) were affected by MYC rearrangements. The distinct biologic behavior of these extranodal lymphomas was reflected by a high complete remission (CR) rate: 7 of 10 patients with MYC rearrangement attained complete remission and 6 responders remained alive for more than 4 years, resulting in a trend for better DFS (P = .07). These data show the complex nature of molecular events in DLCL, which is a reflection of the morphologic and clinical heterogeneity of these lymphomas. However, thus far, these genetic rearrangements fail as prognostic markers. © 1998 by The American Society of Hematology.}

    abstract = { Male gender was recently reported as an adverse prognostic factor in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone). We conducted a retrospective study of adult patients with DLBCL initially treated with rituximab containing regimens between 2001 and 2007. Patients were identified from the clinical archives of 43 Italian and Brazilian institutions. The principal endpoint was overall survival (OS). One thousand seven hundred and ninety-three patients were fully eligible for the study. Thirty-eight percent, 27\%, 22\% and 12\% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 0–1, 2, 3 and 4–5, respectively; 53\% were males. After a median follow-up of 36 months (1–106), the 5-year OS was 76\% (95\% confidence interval 74–78\%). In univariate analysis, male gender was an adverse prognostic factor with a hazard ratio of 1.52. In multivariate analysis, when adjusted by IPI, again gender maintained its prognostic relevance, showing an independent additive effect. In conclusion, in patients with DLBCL treated with rituximab containing regimens, gender may increase the predictive power of the IPI. Based on these results, given possible differences in blood clearance of rituximab between males and females, the benefit of higher doses of rituximab in males should be explored. }

An international trial was also undertaken in younger patients, the MabThera International Trial (MInT).5 The initial rituximab-CHOP (R-CHOP) regimens were empirically designed. These trials were designed without a pharmacologic understanding of rituximab or the half-life of the drug. The outcomes of these trials reported an improved overall survival (OS) when compared with CHOP or CHOP-like regimens and led to the approval of rituximab in combination with CHOP in the United States in February 2006 and in countries worldwide. This was the first monoclonal antibody approved in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.The publication by the Groupe d’ Etude des Lymphomes de L’Adulte was a landmark observation.3 Clinical trials incorporating rituximab into other investigations including the rituximab with CHOP over the age of 60 (RICOVER-60) and the Mega–CHOP plus etoposide (CHOEP) trials were performed.6},

To evaluate treatment, clinical prognostic factors, and outcome in a population-based cohort, we performed a retrospective study comprising 535 de novo DLBCL patients in western Sweden, diagnosed between 1995 and 2000. The median age was 73 years. Treatment with a curative intent was administered to 376 (70\%) patients. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) strongly predicted overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival, but high age (\&gt;68 vs ≤68 years) had no significant influence on response rate (p = 0.86) or PFS (p = 0.14). Male sex had a negative impact on both OS (p \&lt; 0.001) and PFS (p \&lt; 0.001), independent of IPI.

    abstract = { Our aim was to describe a large population-based cohort of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) during the last decade, evaluating possible improvement in survival and to identify subgroups in need of novel treatment strategies. The study population encompassed all patients diagnosed with DLBCL in Sweden from 2000 through 2010. Altogether 5349 patients were identified. There was no increase in incidence for females, but for males there was an estimated yearly increase in incidence by 0.019 per 10 000. When adjusted for age and gender, the improvement in overall survival for the whole group was estimated at 4.5\% per year, most prominent in the age group 60–78 years, and in patients with good performance status. In this large dataset, we were able to detect a clear improvement in overall survival in DLBCL, although restricted to specific prognostic subgroups, and to identify specific disease presentations that significantly affect overall survival. }

abstract = {Abstract Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Despite a high cure rate, too many patients show refractory (ref) or relapsed (rel) disease. This study examines the frequency of recurring gene mutations and their interplay with well-known biomarkers in female and male patients between 18 and 80 years with ref/rel DLBCL compared to patients with complete remission (CR) to identify biological risk factors associated with treatment response, using cohorts of R-CHOP-like treated DLBCL enrolled in clinical trials of the DSHNHL. The biomarker profile of patients differed between younger and elderly patients with ref/rel DLBCL, with a higher frequency of BCL2 translocations in younger patients, and higher numbers of ABC subtypes and MYC protein expression in the elderly. Amplicon sequencing revealed generally higher mutation frequencies in the younger cohort. Mutations in CREBBP and TNFRSF14 were associated with shorter overall survival (OS) only in younger patients. A higher proportion of GNA13 mutations was detected in female patients of the elderly DLBCL patient cohort, clearly emphasizing the striking differences in biomarker distribution between younger and elderly as well as female and male patients.},

    abstract = { Potential molecular alterations based on age and sex are not well defined in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We examined global transcriptome DLBCL data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) via a systems biology approach to determine the molecular differences associated with age and sex. Collectively, sex and age revealed striking transcriptional differences with older age associated with decreased metabolism and telomere functions and female sex was associated with decreased interferon signaling, transcription, cell cycle, and PD-1 signaling. We discovered that the key genes for most groups strongly regulated immune function activity. Furthermore, older females were predicted to have less DLBCL progression versus older males and young females. Finally, analyses in systems biology revealed that JUN and CYCS signaling were the most critical factors associated with tumor progression in older and male patients. We identified important molecular perturbations in DLBCL that were strongly associated with age and sex and were predicted to strongly influence tumor progression. }
